# Hacked: A Dreamscape VR Experience

Hacked was developed during the Immersive Experience Design course at Arizona State University, in collaboration with [Dreamscape Learn](https://www.dreamscapelearn.com). It aims to illustrate the lifecycle and impact of computer viruses on data security. This project enhances public understanding and awareness of data vulnerabilities through an engaging and educational 3D interactive experience

<br />

# Features
- **Immersive Narrative**: Follow the evolution of a virus from creation to a full-scale cybersecurity breach, observing various tactics it employs
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with the environment to understand how data security measures can mitigate digital threats
- **Dynamic Visuals and Sound**: Experience the high stakes of digital security through intense visual and auditory simulation

<br />

# Technical Specifications
- **Unity**: Main platform for developing the interactive 3D environment
- **Any Scripting IDE**: We used Visual Sutdio

<br />


# Installation
- **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine
- **Open Project in Unity**: Open the project by navigating to the project folder within Unity
- **Build and Run**: Build the project in Unity and run it to see the simulation in action

<br />

# Getting Started
Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **Unity Editor (Version 2019.4.40f1 only)**: Download from Unity's official website
- **Dreamscape SDK**: It's great if you already have the SDK! However, I'm unable to share it due to privacy concerns and contractual obligations with Dreamscape
